		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>
		L-systems, or Lindenmayer systems, are often used to create realistic looking
		artificial plant environments. While conceptually simple, L-systems have been
		extended with many features to create realistic plants models based on a
		description of the plant growth patterns. Significant progress has been made in
		providing robust frameworks for modeling artificial plants, but the process of
		creating specific plants species is still very much a manual process that often
		requires a deep understanding of the tools used.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this project we will explore an alternate approach to plant species creation
		using genetic algorithms to automatically evolve plants suitable to particular
		environments.
		</p>
		<p>
		By tuning environmental parameters for the availability of water, the amount of
		sunlight, and the ambient soil conditions, artificial plant species are produced
		which resembling physical plants that may grown in similar environments.
		</p>
		<p>
		With this approach to plant species generation, the underlying L-system
		production rules are evolved based on random mutation combined with a fitness
		function to determine plant survival rates. In addition to the L-systems,
		several additional parameters are introduced to control plant growth and
		simulation at a more
		abstract level.

		<h3>Normal environment parameters</h3>
		<p>Standard simulation using 50% values for all environmental
		   parameters. A variety of plants evolve at random.</p>

		<h3>Barren environment</h3>
		<p>Simulation of a barren environment with low soil nutrient
		   levels. The simulation starts with default parameters after
		   which the nutrient level is decreased. Consequently the
		   plant species become smaller and simpler, appearing grass
		   like. Later the nutrient levels are increased slightly and
		   the sunlight level is decreased as well resulting in the
		   evolution of leafy brush like plants.</p>

		<h3>Dry environment</h3>
		<p>Simulation of a dry environment with low water levels.
		   The initially plant species quickly loose their leaves and
		   begin to grow thick stems which could be used for water
		   storage.</p>

		<h3>Shady environment</h3>
		<p>Simulation of a shady environment with medium nutrient
		   levels. Selectional pressure favors large leafy plants which
		   can collect the most light resulting in a dense forested
		   environment.</p>
